version: 
. 0.1 

name:
. node envelopes 

description:
. simple batch templating tool.

future:
. read properties file instead of hardcoded stuff in render.js
. convert to work with express as middleware.
. convert to streaming

npm modules required:
. lazy (to read files)
. colors (for the console)

to run:
node framework/render.js

how it works, how to use it:
. envelopes only uses 2 keywords, "envelope", and "text"
. the "envelope" keyword denotes that the template has an envelope file.
. the "text" keyword denotes where the text on the file should be inserted.
. envelopes will look for the keyword designated on the package page and insert it based on the key name into the envelope page.
